# basic-java-programs

 I will be adding basic java programs on a daily basis and will try covering as many basic problems as much as possible.
 I will add the problem statement of each program at the beginning of the code with proper java doc type comments.
 There will be single line comments in between for smooth readability of code as and when required.
 At the end, I will also be adding the bugs that I faced writing these programs including the solution to it.
 I will later on add the program names serially in this repo description for smooth accessibility.
 Initially I am setting the goal of adding 10 programs per day.

## Happy learning!!!
